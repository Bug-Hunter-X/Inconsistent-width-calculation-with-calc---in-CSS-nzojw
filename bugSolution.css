Several approaches can improve the consistency of width calculations using `calc()`:

1. **Avoid `calc()` if possible:** If the desired width can be expressed without `calc()`, that's often the simplest and most reliable solution.  For instance, if you can determine a fixed pixel width that works across browsers, prefer that.

2. **Explicitly set parent width:**  Ensure that the parent container's width is explicitly defined (using pixels, percentages, or other units) to reduce ambiguity in the `calc()` function's computation.

3. **Use a more flexible approach:** Consider using Flexbox or Grid layout, which provide robust and predictable mechanisms for distributing space among child elements, minimizing reliance on potentially problematic `calc()` calculations.

4. **Rounding:** You could use `round()` function to round the result of `calc()` to the nearest integer:

```css
div {
  width: round(calc(50% - 10px));
}
```

However, this isn't always a perfect solution and can also cause unexpected behaviour depending on the browsers implementation.

**Example (bug.css):**

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

**Example (bugSolution.css):**

```css
/* Solution using a fixed width (if possible): */
div {
  width: 230px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

/* Solution using flexbox for more predictable layout: */
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.container > div {
  flex: 1;
  margin-right: 10px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```
