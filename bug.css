The following CSS rule has an unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This might result in the div's width being calculated incorrectly, particularly when the parent container's width is not explicitly defined or is smaller than expected. The issue stems from the `calc()` function's interaction with the percentage unit and how browsers handle rounding or floating-point arithmetic.
